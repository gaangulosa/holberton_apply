	<h1>Isaac Asimov, his life and work</h1>
		<p><b>(January 2, 1920 - April 6, 1992)</b> Was a Russian-born American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. During his lifetime, Asimov was considered one of the "Big Three" science fiction writers, along with Robert A. Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke. A prolific writer, he wrote or edited more than <b>500 books</b>. He also wrote an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. Best known for his hard science fiction, Asimov also wrote mysteries and fantasy, as well as much nonfiction.</p>

	<h2>Life</h2>
		<p>Asimov was born in <b>Petrovichi, Russian SFSR</b>, on an unknown date between October 4, 1919, and January 2, 1920, inclusive. Asimov celebrated his birthday on January 2. Asimov's parents were Anna Rachel (née Berman) and Judah Asimov, a family of Russian Jewish millers. He was named Isaac after his mother's father, Isaac Berman. Asimov wrote of his father, "My father, for all his education as an Orthodox Jew, was not Orthodox in his heart", noting that "he didn't recite the myriad prayers prescribed for every action, and he never made any attempt to teach them to me".</p>

		<p>Asimov's family travelled to the United States via Liverpool on the RMS Baltic, arriving on February 3, 1923 when he was three years old. His parents spoke Yiddish and English with him, and he remained fluent in those; he never learned Russian. Growing up in <b>Brooklyn, New York</b>, Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five (and later taught his sister to read as well, enabling her to enter school in the second grade). His mother got him into first grade a year early by claiming he was born on September 7, 1919. In third grade he learned about the <b>"error"</b> and insisted on an official correction of the date to January 2. He became a naturalized <b>U.S. citizen</b> in 1928 at the age of eight.</p>

		<p>Asimov attended <b>New York City public schools</b> from age five, including Boys High School in Brooklyn. Graduating at 15, he attended the <b>City College of New York</b> for several days before accepting a scholarship at Seth Low Junior College. This was a branch of <b>Columbia University</b> in Downtown Brooklyn designed to absorb some of the academically qualified Jewish and Italian-American students who applied to the more prestigious Columbia College, but exceeded the unwritten ethnic admission quotas which were common at the time. Originally a zoology major, Asimov switched to chemistry after his first semester because he disapproved of "dissecting an alley cat". After Seth Low Junior College closed in 1936, Asimov finished his Bachelor of Science degree at <b>Columbia's Morningside Heights</b> campus (later the Columbia University School of General Studies) in 1939.</p>

	<h2>Writings</h2>
		<p>Asimov's early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950.</p>

		<p>Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of <b>Foundation's Edge</b>. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories. Doubleday and Houghton Mifflin published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that "both represent a father image".</p>

	<h3>Science fiction</h3>
		<p>Asimov became a <b>science fiction fan</b> in 1929, when he began reading the pulp magazines sold in his family's candy store. At first his father forbade reading pulps until Asimov persuaded him that because the science fiction magazines had <b>"Science"</b> in the title, they must be educational. At age 18 he joined the Futurians science fiction fan club, where he made friends who went on to become science fiction writers or editors.</p>

		<p>Asimov began writing at the age of 11, imitating <b>The Rover Boys</b> with eight chapters of The Greenville Chums at College. His father bought him a used typewriter at age 16. His first published work was a humorous item on the birth of his brother for Boys High School's literary journal in 1934. In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, "Cosmic Corkscrew" (now lost), that year.</p>

		<p>After writing "Victory Unintentional" in January and February 1942, Asimov did not write another story for a year. Asimov expected to make chemistry his career. In 1942, Asimov published the first of his Foundation stories—later collected in the <b>Foundation trilogy:</b> <em>Foundation</em> (1951), <em>Foundation and Empire</em> (1952), and <em>Second Foundation</em> (1953). The books describe the fall of a vast interstellar empire and the establishment of its eventual successor. They also feature his fictional science of <b>psychohistory</b>, in which the future course of the history of large populations can be predicted.</p>

		<p>The trilogy and <b>Robot series</b> are his most famous science fiction. His "positronic" robot stories—many of which were collected in <b>I, Robot</b> (1950)—were begun at about the same time. They promulgated a set of rules of ethics for robots (Three Laws of Robotics) and intelligent machines that greatly influenced other writers and thinkers in their treatment of the subject. Asimov notes in his introduction to the short story collection <b>The Complete Robot</b> (1982) that he was largely inspired by the tendency of robots up to that time to fall consistently into a Frankenstein plot in which they destroyed their creators.<p>

		<p>Due to pressure by fans on Asimov to write another book in his Foundation series, he did so with <em>Foundation's Edge</em> (1982) and <em>Foundation and Earth</em> (1986), and then went back to before the original trilogy with <em>Prelude to Foundation</em> (1988) and <em>Forward the Foundation</em> (1992), his last novel.</p>

	<h3>Coined Terms</h3>
		<p>Asimov coined the term <b>"robotics"</b> in his 1941 story "Liar!", though he later remarked that he believed then that he was merely using an existing word, as he stated in Gold ("The Robot Chronicles"). While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one third of the way down the first column of page 100, Astounding Science Fiction, March 1942 printing of his short story "Runaround".</p>
