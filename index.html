	<h1>Nuclear Energy</h1>

	<h2>What is Nuclear Energy?</h2>
		<p><img src="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/styles/original_image_size/public/nuclearpower-1140x640.jpg?itok=gwVrY8nK" width="400" height="200"></p>

		<p>Nuclear energy is a form of energy released from the nucleus, the core of atoms, made up of protons and neutrons. This source of energy can be produced in two ways: <b>fission</b> – when nuclei of atoms split into several parts – or <b>fusion</b> – when nuclei fuse together.</p>

		<p>The nuclear energy harnessed around the world today to produce electricity is through <b>nuclear fission</b>, while technology to generate electricity from <b>fusion</b> is at the R&D phase. This article will explore nuclear fission.</p>

	<h2>How does nuclear fission work?</h2>
		<p><img src="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/nuclearfission-1140x640.jpg" width="600" height="350"></p>

		<p>Nuclear fission is a <b>reaction</b> where the nucleus of an atom splits into two or more smaller nuclei, while releasing energy.</p>

		<p>For instance, when hit by a neutron, the nucleus of an atom of uranium-235 splits into two smaller nuclei, for example a barium nucleus and a krypton nucleus and two or three neutrons. These extra neutrons will hit other surrounding <b>uranium-235 atoms</b>, which will also split and generate additional neutrons in a multiplying effect, thus generating a chain reaction in a fraction of a second.</p>

		<p>Each time the reaction occurs, there is a release of energy in the form of <b>heat</b> and <b>radiation</b>. The heat can be converted into electricity in a nuclear power plant, similarly to how heat from fossil fuels such as coal, gas and oil is used to generate electricity.</p>


	<h2>How does a nuclear power plant work?</h2>
		<p><img src="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/pwr-1140x640.jpg" width="600" height="350"></p>

		<p>A nuclear power plant is an industrial site that generates electricity from <b>nuclear power</b>, released in the form of <b>thermal energy</b> through a <b>nuclear fission</b> chain reaction inside the vessel of a <b>nuclear reactor</b>.</p>

		<p>The main component of a nuclear power plant is the <b>nuclear reactor</b>, which contains the nuclear fuel (usually <b>uranium</b>) and has systems that make it possible to start, sustain and stop the nuclear reaction in a controlled manner.</p>

		<p>The way a nuclear power plant works is similar to a conventional thermal plant, where thermal energy is obtained through the combustion of fossil fuels. In a nuclear reactor, however, this energy is obtained via the nuclear fission chain reactions of the uranium atoms from the nuclear fuel.</p>

	<h3>The way a nuclear power plant works can be simplified into five stages:</h3>
		<ol> 
			<li>The uranium fission takes place inside the nuclear reactor. It releases a large amount of energy that heats the coolant water circulating at a very high pressure. This water is transported via the primary circuit to a heat exchanger (steam generator) that produces water steam.</li>
			<li>This steam is transported to the generator-turbine set via a secondary circuit.</li>
			<li>Once there, the vanes in the turbine move the alternator and the mechanic energy is transformed into electricity.</li>
			<li>When the water steam goes through the turbine it is sent to a condenser to cool off and become liquid water again.</li>
		</ol>


	<h3>Types of nuclear reactors</h3>
		<p>There are different types of nuclear reactors, but two outstanding designs are present in over 80% of the almost 450 operative units in the world:</p>
		<ul> 
			<li>Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR).</li>
			<li>Boiling Water Reactor (BWR).</li>
		</ul>

	<h3>Reactor main components</h3>
		<p>The central component of a uclear power plant is the reactor, the site that houses the nuclear fuel. It was previously indicated that a nuclear reactor is a site that can initiate, sustain and stop nuclear fission chain reactions in a controlled way, with the adequate means to extract the generated heat.</p>

		<p>It's main components are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Fuel: </b>The material, usually enriched uranium dioxide, where the fission reactions take place. It is used simultaneously as a source of energy and of neutrons to sustain the chain reaction. It is presented in a solid state in the form of cylindrical pills encapsulated into metallic rods a few meters long.</li>
			<li><b>Moderator: </b> Water that slows down the fast neutrons generated by the fission, which leads to new fissions and the sustainment of the chain reaction.</li>
			<li><b>Cooling water: </b>The same water that induces the fissions as a moderator, which now serves to extract the heat generated by the fission reaction from the uranium in the fuel.</li>
			<li><b>Control rods: </b>The control elements in the reactor. They act as neutron absorbers. These rods are made of indium-cadmium or boron carbide and make it possible to constantly control the neutron population whilst keeping the reactor stable; they also make it possible to stop the reaction whenever necessary.</li>
			<li><b>Shielding: </b>It prevents the leak of radiations and neutrons from inside the reactor to the outside. Usually shielding is made up of concrete, steel or lead.</li>
			<li><b>Safety elements: </b>All nuclear power plants have multiple safety systems to prevent the leak of radioactivity to the outside. These systems include the containment building.</li>
		</ul>

	<h2>In social media</h2>
		<p>Nuclear energy topic is also discussed in the social media. Some organizations like IAEA (International Atomic Energy Agency) and the US Office of Nuclear Energy shares information about the pacific use of nuclear energy. <a href="tweets.html"> Click here</a> to see some tweets about this interesting topic.</p>
