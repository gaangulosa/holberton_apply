	<h1>Waste management in nuclear power plants</h1>
	
	<h3>What is Radioctive waste?</h3>
		<p>Waste that has radioactive material (material with the emission of radiation) is categorized as radioactive or nuclear waste. These radioactive wastes are extremely hazardous to the environment as they affect most living organisms. These materials are carcinogenic, which means it has the potential to cause cancer.</p>

	<h3>Is nuclear waste handled safely?</h3>
		<p>Once removed from a reactor, used fuel assemblies initially cool down in a storage pool. The concrete and steel pool and the water shield workers from radioactivity.</p>

		<p>When cool enough that it no longer needs to be stored underwater—typically for 2 to 5 years after removal from the reactor—used fuel is transferred and stored in dry casks, which are large steel-reinforced concrete containers. These casks are designed for long term storage until a site is available for permanent disposal. They’re safe enough to walk up to and touch.</p>

	<h3>What happens to nuclear waste?</h3>
		<p>In the case of US, the nuclear industry handles nuclear waste safely and in compliance with the stringent requirements of the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.</p>

		<p>The NRC divides waste from nuclear plants into two categories: high-level and low-level. High-level waste is mostly used fuel. Low-level waste includes items like gloves, tools or machine parts that have been exposed to radioactive materials and makes up most of the volume of waste produced by plants.</p>

		<p>Low-level radioactive waste is collected and transported safely to one of four disposal facilities in South Carolina, Washington, Utah or Texas. Some low-level waste can be stored at the plant until its stops being radioactive and is safe to be disposed of like normal trash.</p>

		<p>A permanent disposal site for high-level waste has been planned for Yucca Mountain, Nevada, since 1987. This proposal has been found to meet NRC’s and EPA’s stringent safety and environmental regulations.  Nevertheless, the project remains stalled by lack of funding from Congress. Whether it is at Yucca Mountain or some other location, DOE will transport and dispose of all U.S. commercial used fuel. All major nuclear countries in the world are pursuing similar disposal sites.  Finland is in the lead with a site licensed and under construction. Consolidated interim storage sites also have been proposed so that used fuel can be more efficiently managed until a disposal site becomes available.</p>
